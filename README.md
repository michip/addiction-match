### 1. Why did we do that?
Project **help me, help you** have been created during [Junction 2020 Hackathon](https://connected.hackjunction.com/).
The challenge states: "Create an innovative and implementable solution for drug use prevention among youth!"
Our [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZyKlZCjmMc&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Uplift) says more than thousand words.

### 2. Hot run project locally
Easiest way is to use docker-compose configuration. Prerequisites for that are docker and docker-compose installed. Then it's just as simple as firing invoking a command 'docker-compose up -d --build'. It set up Django app in a backend backed by Postgresql. The front-end is served with Vue.js.

### 3. On-line demo
App is available under http://www.help-you-help.me.
